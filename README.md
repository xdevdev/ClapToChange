### What is ClapToChange
  Have you ever experienced about this? Presentation with your pointer, You can't fully show your gestures. Or it could be a presentation in front of the classroom with someone standing in front of the computer and pressing the slide. For the projects that our group has created to make presentations more comfortable. In your hand, you don't have to hold any device. Just by clapping at the rhythm or pattern, your work slides will go all out.

### How does the clap detection/Recognition work?
It’s work by the calculation of the amplitude of the wave. When we clapped the amplitude goes higher. Likewise, when we are quiet, the graph or wave will look plummeting.

V_rms=  1/√2× V_peak                            √((∑_(i=1)^n▒x^2 )/N)=Vrms
       v_avg=(∑_(i=1)^n▒x_i )/N                                           v_mean=∑x_i/N
〖       v〗_med=((n+1))/2
